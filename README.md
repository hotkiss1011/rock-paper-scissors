# rock-paper-scissors

This is a browser game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that I've created for the Odin Project. I will be using HTML to create a form for the user to input their answer. I will be using some CSS to style this form to create a pleasing visual user experience. Finally, I will be using JavaScript to build the game which will randomly select Rock, Paper or Scissors.

1. Computer will randomly select Rock, Paper, or Scissors on load. (This will be hidden from user.)
2. Player will select Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats rock, and rock beats paper.
